Each stay booked with Yuzi includes luxury hotel accommodations, a 24-hour nursery, nutritious meals and snacks, onsite experts in postpartum care, infant care education, and social programming. Our experience combines modern luxury amenities with the ancient wisdom of "Yuezi" and is tailored to the needs of each guest.
