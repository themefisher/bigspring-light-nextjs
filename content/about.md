Yuzi is a haven designed specifically for moms during one of the most challenging periods of their lives—the postnatal journey. Our retreat offers a nurturing and supportive environment where mothers can find solace, rejuvenation, and connection as they navigate the joys and demands of early motherhood. 

#### The Essence of Zuo Yue Zi

Drawing from the time-honored tradition of Zuo Yue Zi, or "Sitting the Month", we pay homage to the ancient practice of postpartum confinement. With deep respect for this cultural heritage, we have woven its essence into the fabric of our retreat, offering mothers a space to focus on their recovery, bond with their babies, and embrace the beauty of motherhood. Our retreat is the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest, a pioneering endeavor to bring this cherished practice into the embrace of contemporary life.

#### A Sanctuary for Healing and Empowerment

At Yuzi, we understand the unique physical, emotional, and mental needs that arise after childbirth. We believe that every mom deserves dedicated care and attention during this transformative phase, which is why our retreat is meticulously crafted to provide a sanctuary of healing, restoration, and empowerment.
